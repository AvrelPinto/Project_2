    <h2>✿ About Us ✿</h2>
    <p>Founded in 9th grade by a student with a deep passion for design, craftsmanship, and creativity, the journey began as a small hobby of making unique, handmade products. Using raw materials carefully sourced from online marketplaces, each item was thoughtfully crafted with attention to detail and a personal touch. Over time, the dedication and love for creating grew stronger, and what started as a one-person endeavor soon evolved into something bigger. Later, the founder partnered with their best friend, combining skills, ideas, and shared enthusiasm to expand the store’s reach, improve product quality, and bring even more creative designs to customers.</p>
